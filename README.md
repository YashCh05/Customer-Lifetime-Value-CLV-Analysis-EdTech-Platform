---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Returning students generate significantly higher CLV than new students
- Programming and Data Analytics courses are the strongest CLV contributors
- Higher engagement (learning minutes & completion rate) leads to higher CLV
- Revenue spikes alone do not ensure sustained CLV — retention does

---

## 📈 Outcome
This project demonstrates how CLV-focused analysis can help businesses move beyond short-term revenue metrics and prioritize **retention-driven, long-term growth strategies**.
